        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a young student, I do not have much professional experience, I have barely lived a life. However, I did start to introduce myself more to the workforce and other activities. For example, once I turned seventeen, I knew that I had to start doing something for myself, earn my own money, and buy my own things. I started my first job at a McDonaldâ€™s near my house. At first, I went through many difficulties, it being my first job and all, and having to get used to the pace and pressure of working at a fast food restaurant. I slowly got used to it, and I was able to handle more on my own. While working there, I worked on old skills and gained new ones. It taught me how to deal with certain customers, and helped me with being able to multi-task as well as organizing my time. Not only that, I learned more about money and transactions in general when I was put as a cashier. Since I am bilingual, (fluent in English and Spanish), I was able to help more customers when there was a language barrier, it also helped me on perfecting my Spanish. <br><br>

        Going back to dealing with customers, most tended to be kind and understanding, but for those who were not, I learned to be able to manage what their problem was to see if I would be able to help in any way. If there was no way for me to help, that is when I would go to a higher-up, a manager, and let them handle the rest of the transaction. The pressure that came with the job was something else, fast food restaurants always tend to be busy, and I knew that, but it was more than what I expected. During the school year, I would work weekend mornings, and those were the busiest days of the year since everyone was home and wanted breakfast. I would go from taking a long line of orders, while refilling the coffee at the same time, as well as helping out my coworkers with orders in any way that I could. <br><br>

        On top of that, to optimize our time as a team, our goal was to finish an order under a certain time and erase it off the order board, adding just a little more pressure. When working at the drive-through, it was a little harder for me since listening through headphones, not everything sounds very clear. I also had to learn to take multiple orders, one after another while charging customers at the same time, and managed to do simple math in my head to give customers their correct change. I was also given the task of cleaning while it was slow in order to keep a nice appearance of the store. In addition, I was able to memorize the steps to making all types of drinks that were offered at the store, as well as making any altercations if needed by the customer.
